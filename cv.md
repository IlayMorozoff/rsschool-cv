## About me
I am 26 years old, I live in Yaroslavl, Russia. I am fond of programming and initially it was as a hobby for the soul, but now I realized that I am ready to change my specialization and go to IT, because I feel in my place. At the moment I work as a design engineer in a large energy company.

I learn quickly enough and grasp any information on the fly, trying to apply it in real or educational projects, and I always try to understand the essence of the problem with broken code, so as not to make mistakes in the future. I am in constant learning, because programming is constantly changing, and I like it.
